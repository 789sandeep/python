# # Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.

# A4. DQL stands for Data Query Language, which is a subset of SQL used to retrieve data from a database. DQL statements are used to query and retrieve data from one or more tables in a database.

# The most commonly used DQL statement is SELECT, which is used to retrieve data from one or more tables based on specified criteria. The SELECT statement can be used to retrieve specific columns or all columns from a table, and can also include filtering criteria, sorting criteria, and grouping criteria.

# Here's an example of how to use SELECT to retrieve data from a table:

# Assume we have a table called "students" with columns "id", "name", "age", and "gender". To retrieve all the data from the "students" table, we can use the following SELECT statement:

# sql
# Copy code
# SELECT * FROM students;
# This statement will retrieve all the data from the "students" table.

# If we only want to retrieve the name and age columns from the "students" table, we can modify the SELECT statement like this:

# sql
# Copy code
# SELECT name, age FROM students;
# This statement will retrieve only the "name" and "age" columns from the "students" table.

# We can also use filtering criteria to retrieve specific data. For example, to retrieve only female students from the "students" table, we can modify the SELECT statement like this:

# sql
# Copy code
# SELECT * FROM students
# WHERE gender = 'female';
# This statement will retrieve all the data from the "students" table where the gender column is 'female'.

# The SELECT statement is an essential tool for retrieving data from a database and can be used in various ways to retrieve specific columns, filter data, sort data, and group data based on specific criteria.
