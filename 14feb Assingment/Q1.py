# Q.1.what is multithreading in python? hy is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.
# Multithreading in Python is a technique where a program can execute multiple threads (or small units of execution) concurrently within the same process. Each thread runs independently and shares the same memory space, allowing for efficient and effective use of system resources.

# Multithreading is commonly used in Python to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, such as processing data, handling user input, and performing I/O operations, without blocking the main program's execution.

# In Python, the threading module is used to handle threads. This module provides a simple and efficient way to create and manage threads in a Python program. It allows the programmer to create new threads, start them, pause and resume their execution, and synchronize their actions. The threading module also provides tools for synchronizing access to shared resources and avoiding race conditions.
