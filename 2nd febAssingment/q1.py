# What is For Loop?
# For loop is used to iterate over elements of a sequence. It is often used when you have a piece of code which you want to repeat “n” number of time.

# What is While Loop?
# While Loop is used to repeat a block of code. Instead of running the code block once, It executes the code block multiple times until a certain condition is met.
