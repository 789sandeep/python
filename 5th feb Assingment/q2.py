# Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs. in python?

# The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:

# 1.Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the practice of hiding the internal details of an object from the outside world and exposing only what is necessary. In Python, this can be achieved using classes, which allow you to group data and behavior into a single entity.

# 2.Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of identifying essential features of an object and ignoring the rest. In Python, this can be achieved by defining abstract classes, which are classes that cannot be instantiated but define a blueprint for other classes to follow.

# 3.Inheritance: Inheritance is the mechanism by which a class can derive properties and behavior from another class. In Python, this is achieved by using the "class derived_class(base_class):" syntax, where the derived_class inherits from the base_class.

# 4.Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on different forms or behaviors depending on the context. In Python, this can be achieved using method overriding, where a subclass can provide a different implementation of a method defined in its superclass. Another way to achieve polymorphism in Python is through duck typing, which allows objects to be treated as if they belong to a particular type if they have the required attributes and methods.
