# Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example. in python

# The __init__() function in Python is a special method that is called when an object is created from a class. It is used to initialize the instance variables of the object with default or user-defined values.

class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width

# Creating objects of class Rectangle
rect1 = Rectangle(10, 20)
rect2 = Rectangle(5, 15)

# Calling the area method on the objects
print(rect1.area())  # Output: 200
print(rect2.area())  # Output: 75

# In this example, we define a Rectangle class with an __init__() method that takes two parameters - length and width. Inside the method, we use these parameters to set the length and width instance variables of the object.

# We then create two objects of the Rectangle class, rect1 and rect2, and pass in different values for the length and width parameters. Finally, we call the area() method on both objects to calculate and print their area.

# Without the __init__() method, we would have to set the length and width variables separately after creating the object. The __init__() method allows us to set the initial state of the object in a more convenient and readable way. Additionally, if we want to ensure that all instances of the class have the necessary attributes, we can add parameter validation and default values in the __init__() method.
