# Q!.Name any five plots that we can plot using the Seaborn library. Also, state the uses of each plot.

# Sure, here are five plots that can be created using the Seaborn library along with their uses:

# Scatter plot - A scatter plot can be used to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables. It is useful to see whether there is any correlation or pattern between the two variables.
# Bar plot - A bar plot can be used to show the distribution of a categorical variable or to compare the values of a categorical variable across different groups. It is useful to see the frequency or proportion of each category in a dataset.
# Heatmap - A heatmap can be used to show the correlation between different variables in a dataset. It is useful to identify which variables are highly correlated and to see the overall pattern of the data.
# Box plot - A box plot can be used to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable. It is useful to see the median, quartiles, and outliers of the data.
# Count plot - A count plot can be used to show the frequency of a categorical variable. It is useful to see the number of instances of each category in a dataset.
