# Q1. What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.

# API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules, protocols, and tools for building software applications that allow different software systems to communicate with each other. APIs define how one application can interact with another application or service to exchange data, access functionality, or integrate with other systems.

# Here's an example of how an API is used in real life:

# Consider a weather application that displays the current temperature and forecast for a particular location. The application needs to retrieve weather data from a server to provide this information to the user. The server provides this information through an API. The API allows the weather application to make requests to the server and receive data in a format that the application can understand. The weather application can then use this data to display the temperature and forecast to the user.

# Another example is the Google Maps API, which allows developers to embed Google Maps on their websites or applications and customize the maps with additional features such as location markers, directions, and street view. This API enables applications to access mapping and location-based data, allowing developers to create location-aware applications and services.
