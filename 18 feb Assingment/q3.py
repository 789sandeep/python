# Q3. What is a Web API? Differentiate between API and Web API.

# A Web API, also known as a web service, is an API that is accessed over the internet using standard web protocols, such as HTTP and HTTPS. Web APIs provide a standardized way for applications to communicate with each other, allowing data to be exchanged and services to be accessed across different platforms and technologies.

# Here are the main differences between API and Web API:

# Scope: APIs can refer to any type of interface that enables communication between software applications, while Web APIs specifically refer to APIs that are accessed over the internet using web protocols.

# Communication: APIs can use a variety of communication protocols, such as REST, SOAP, and XML-RPC, while Web APIs typically use HTTP or HTTPS.

# Transport: APIs can use different transport mechanisms, such as sockets, message queues, or remote procedure calls, while Web APIs use the HTTP transport protocol to send and receive data.

# Implementation: APIs can be implemented in different ways, such as libraries, SDKs, or custom code, while Web APIs are often implemented as web services that run on web servers and expose their functionality through HTTP endpoints.

# In summary, while API is a more general term that can refer to any type of interface that enables communication between software applications, Web API specifically refers to APIs that are accessed over the internet using web protocols, providing a standardized way for applications to communicate with each other over the web.
