# Q.1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and syntax errors.

# Ans.1.An exception in Python is an error that occurs during the execution of a program, which disrupts the normal flow of the program. When an exception occurs, Python creates an instance of an exception object and raises it. If the exception is not handled by the program, it will cause the program to terminate with an error message.

# On the other hand, syntax errors in Python are errors that occur when the interpreter cannot understand the code because it violates the syntax rules of the language. Syntax errors are detected during the parsing stage before the program is executed. They prevent the program from running, and the interpreter displays a syntax error message that points to the location of the error in the code.

# The key difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that exceptions occur during program execution when something unexpected happens, while syntax errors are detected before the program is executed. Exceptions are caused by things such as file not found, division by zero, or invalid input. They can be handled by the program using the try-except statement. In contrast, syntax errors are caused by things like missing or misplaced punctuation, misspelled keywords, or invalid function calls.

# To summarize, exceptions and syntax errors are two types of errors in Python. Exceptions occur during program execution when something unexpected happens, while syntax errors are detected before the program is executed due to syntax violations.
