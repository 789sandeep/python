# Q1: What is Matplotlib? Why is it used? Name five plots that can be plotted using the Pyplot module of Matplotlib.

# Matplotlib is a data visualization library in Python that is used to create 2D plots and graphs. It is a powerful tool for creating visual representations of data and can be used to generate a wide range of plots, from simple line graphs to complex heatmaps.

# Matplotlib is widely used in the scientific and data analysis communities to visualize data and communicate insights to others. It can be used to create publication-quality figures for research papers and presentations.

# The Pyplot module of Matplotlib is a sublibrary that provides a simple interface for creating a variety of plots. Here are five types of plots that can be created using the Pyplot module:

# Line plot: A line plot is a simple plot that displays the relationship between two variables as a line. It is useful for visualizing trends over time or comparing the relationship between two variables.

# Scatter plot: A scatter plot is a plot that displays the relationship between two variables as a collection of points. It is useful for visualizing the correlation between two variables.

# Bar plot: A bar plot is a plot that displays the values of different categories as bars. It is useful for comparing the values of different categories.

# Histogram: A histogram is a plot that displays the distribution of a single variable by dividing it into bins and counting the number of observations in each bin. It is useful for visualizing the frequency distribution of a variable.

# Heatmap: A heatmap is a plot that displays the relationship between two variables as a color-coded matrix. It is useful for visualizing the correlation between two variables or for displaying the frequency of events in a matrix.
